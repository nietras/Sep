```

## Naming and Terminology
Sep uses naming and terminology that is not based on [RFC-4180](#rfc-4180), but
is more tailored to usage in machine learning or similar. Additionally, Sep
takes a pragmatic approach towards names by using short names and abbreviations
where it makes sense and there should be no ambiguity given the context. That
is, using `Sep` for `Separator` and `Col` for `Column` to keep code succinct.

|Term | Description |
|-----|-------------|
|`Sep` | Short for separator, also called *delimiter*. E.g. comma (`,`) is the separator for the separated values in a `csv`-file. |
|`Header` | Optional first row defining names of columns. |
|`Row` | A row is a collection of col(umn)s, which may span multiple lines. Also called *record*. |
|`Col` | Short for column, also called *field*. |
|`Line` | Horizontal set of characters until a line ending; `\r\n`, `\r`, `\n`. |
|`Index` | 0-based that is `RowIndex` will be 0 for first row (or the header if present). |
|`Number` | 1-based that is `LineNumber` will be 1 for the first line (as in `notepad`). Given a row may span multiple lines a row can have a *start* line number and an *end* line number. |

## Application Programming Interface (API)
Besides being the succinct name of the library, `Sep` is both the main entry
point to using the library and the container for a validated separator. That is,
`Sep` is basically defined as:
```csharp
public readonly record struct Sep(char Separator);
```
The separator `char` is validated upon construction and is guaranteed to be
within a limited range and not being a `char` like `"` (quote) or similar. This
can be seen in [src/Sep/Sep.cs](src/Sep/Sep.cs). The separator is constrained
also for internal optimizations, so you cannot use any `char` as a separator.

⚠ Note that all types are within the namespace `nietras.SeparatedValues` and not
`Sep` since it is problematic to have a type and a namespace with the same name.

To get started you can use `Sep` as the static entry point to building either a
reader or writer. That is, for `SepReader`:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromFile("titanic.csv");
```
where `.Reader()` is a convenience method corresponding to:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Auto.Reader().FromFile("titanic.csv");
```
where `Sep? Auto => null;` is a static property that returns `null` for a
nullable `Sep` to signify that the separator should be inferred from the first
row, which might be a header. If the first row does not contain any of the by
default supported separators or there are no rows, the default separator will be
used.

⚠ Note Sep uses `;` as the default separator, since this is what was used in an
internal proprietary library which Sep was built to replace. This is also to
avoid issues with comma `,` being used as a decimal separator in some locales.
Without having to resort to quoting.

If you want to specify the separator you can write:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.New(',').Reader().FromFile("titanic.csv");
```
or
```csharp
var sep = new Sep(',');
using var reader = sep.Reader().FromFile("titanic.csv");
```
Similarly, for `SepWriter`:
```csharp
using var writer = Sep.Writer().ToFile("titanic.csv");
```
or
```csharp
using var writer = Sep.New(',').Writer().ToFile("titanic.csv");
```
where you have to specify a valid separator, since it cannot be inferred. To
fascillitate easy flow of the separator and `CultureInfo` both `SepReader` and
`SepWriter` expose a `Spec` property of type [`SepSpec`](src/Sep/SepSpec.cs) that simply defines those
two. This means you can write:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromFile("titanic.csv");
using var writer = reader.Spec.Writer().ToFile("titanic-survivors.csv");
```
where the `writer` then will use the separator inferred by the reader, for
example.

### API Pattern
In general, both reading and writing follow a similar pattern:
```
Sep/Spec => SepReaderOptions => SepReader => Row => Col(s) => Span/ToString/Parse
Sep/Spec => SepWriterOptions => SepWriter => Row => Col(s) => Set/Format
```
where each continuation flows fluently from the preceding type. For example,
`Reader()` is an extension method to `Sep` or `SepSpec` that returns a
`SepReaderOptions`. Similarly, `Writer()` is an extension method to `Sep` or
`SepSpec` that returns a `SepWriterOptions`.

[`SepReaderOptions`](src/Sep/SepReaderOptions.cs)  and
[`SepWriterOptions`](src/Sep/SepWriterOptions.cs) are optionally configurable.
That and the APIs for reader and writer is covered in the following sections.

For a complete example, see the [example](#example) above or the
[ReadMeTest.cs](src/Sep.Test/ReadMeTest.cs).

⚠ Note that it is important to understand that Sep `Row`/`Col`/`Cols` are [`ref
struct`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/ref-struct)s
(please follow the `ref struct` link and understand how this limits the usage of
those). This is due to these types being simple *facades* or indirections to the
underlying reader or writer. That means you cannot use LINQ or create an array
of all rows like `reader.ToArray()` as the reader is not `IEnumerable<>` either
since `ref struct`s cannot be used in interfaces, which is in fact the point.
Hence, you need to parse or copy to different types instead. The same applies to
`Col`/`Cols` which point to internal state that is also reused. This is to avoid
repeated allocations for each row and get the best possible performance, while
still defining a well structured and straightforward API that guides users to
relevant functionality.  See [Why SepReader Is Not IEnumerable and LINQ
Compatible](#why-sepreader-is-not-ienumerable-and-linq-compatible) for more.

### SepReader API
`SepReader` API has the following structure (in pseudo-C# code):
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader(o => o).FromFile/FromText/From...;
var header = reader.Header;
var _ = header.IndexOf/IndicesOf/NamesStartingWith...;
foreach (var row in reader)
{
    var _ = row[colName/colNames].Span/ToString/Parse<T>...;
    var _ = row[colIndex/colIndices].Span/ToString/Parse<T>...;
}
```
That is, to use `SepReader` follow the points below:

 1. Optionally define `Sep` or use default automatically inferred separator.
 1. Specify reader with optional configuration of `SepReaderOptions`. For
    example, if a csv-file does not have a header this can be configured via:
    ```csharp
    Sep.Reader(o => o with { HasHeader = false })
    ```
    For all options consult the properties on the options type.
 1. Specify source e.g. file, text (`string`), `TextWriter`, etc. via `From`
    extension methods.
 1. Optionally access the header. For example, to get all columns starting with
    `GT_` use:
    ```csharp
    var colNames = header.NamesStarting("GT_");
    var colIndices = header.IndicesOf(colNames);
    ```
 1. Enumerate rows. One row at a time. 
 1. Access a column by name or index. Or access multiple columns with names and
    indices. `Sep` internally handles pooled allocation and reuse of arrays for
    multiple columns.
 1. Use `Span` to access the column directly as a `ReadOnlySpan<char>`. Or use
    `ToString` to convert to a `string`. Or use `Parse<T>` where `T :
    ISpanParsable<T>` to parse the column `char`s to a specific type.

#### Why SepReader Is Not IEnumerable and LINQ Compatible
As mentioned earlier Sep only allows enumeration and access to one row at a time
and `SepReader.Row` is just a simple *facade* or indirection to the underlying
reader. This is why it is defined as a `ref struct`. In fact, the following code:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
foreach (var row in reader)
{ }
```
can also be rewritten as:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
while (reader.MoveNext())
{
    var row = reader.Current;
}
```
where `row` is just a *facade* for exposing row specific functionality. That is,
`row` is still basically the `reader` underneath. Hence, let's imagine *if*
`SepReader` did implement `IEnumerable<SepReader.Row>` and the `Row` was *not* a
`ref struct`. Then, you would be able to write something like below:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
SepReader.Row[] rows = reader.ToArray();
```
Given `Row` is just a facade for the reader, this would be equivalent to
writing:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
SepReader[] rows = reader.ToArray();
```
which hopefully makes it clear why this is not a good thing. The array would
effectively be the reader repeated several times. If this would have to be
supported one would have to allocate memory for each row always, which would
basically be no different than a `ReadLine` approach as benchmarked in
[Comparison Benchmarks](#comparison-benchmarks).

This is perhaps also the reason why no other efficient .NET CSV parser (known to
author) implements an API pattern like Sep, but instead let the reader define
all functionality directly and hence only let's you access the current row and
cols on that. This API, however, is in this authors opinion not ideal and can be
a bit confusing, which is why Sep is designed like it is. The downside is the
above caveat.

If you want to use LINQ or similar you have to first parse or transform the rows
into some other type and enumerate it. This is easy to do and instead of
counting lines you should focus on how such enumeration can be easily expressed
using C# iterators (aka `yield return`). With local functions this can be done
inside a method like:
```csharp
var text = """
           Key;Value
           A;1.1
           B;2.2
           """;
var expected = new (string Key, double Value)[] {
    ("A", 1.1),
    ("B", 2.2),
};

using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
var actual = Enumerate(reader).ToArray();

CollectionAssert.AreEqual(expected, actual);

static IEnumerable<(string Key, double Value)> Enumerate(SepReader reader)
{
    foreach (var row in reader)
    {
        yield return (row["Key"].ToString(), row["Value"].Parse<double>());
    }
}
```
Now if instead refactoring this to something LINQ-compatible by defining a
common `Enumerate` or similar method it could be:
```csharp
var text = """
           Key;Value
           A;1.1
           B;2.2
           """;
var expected = new (string Key, double Value)[] {
    ("A", 1.1),
    ("B", 2.2),
};

using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
var actual = Enumerate(reader,
    row => (row["Key"].ToString(), row["Value"].Parse<double>()))
    .ToArray();

CollectionAssert.AreEqual(expected, actual);

static IEnumerable<T> Enumerate<T>(SepReader reader, SepReader.RowFunc<T> func)
{
    foreach (var row in reader)
    {
        yield return func(row);
    }
}
```
Which discounting the `Enumerate` method (which could naturally be an extension
method), does have less boilerplate, but not really more effective lines of
code. The issue here is that this tends to favor factoring code in a way that
can become very inefficient quickly. Consider if one wanted to only enumerate
rows matching a predicate on `Key` which meant only 1% of rows were to be
enumerated e.g.:
```csharp
var text = """
           Key;Value
           A;1.1
           B;2.2
           """;
var expected = new (string Key, double Value)[] {
    ("B", 2.2),
};

using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
var actual = Enumerate(reader,
    row => (row["Key"].ToString(), row["Value"].Parse<double>()))
    .Where(kv => kv.Item1.StartsWith("B", StringComparison.Ordinal))
    .ToArray();

CollectionAssert.AreEqual(expected, actual);

static IEnumerable<T> Enumerate<T>(SepReader reader, SepReader.RowFunc<T> func)
{
    foreach (var row in reader)
    {
        yield return func(row);
    }
}
```
This means you are still parsing the double (which is magnitudes slower than
getting just the key) for all rows. Imagine if this was an array of floating
points or similar. Not only would you then be parsing a lot of values you would
also be allocated 99x arrays that aren't used after filtering with `Where`.

Instead, you should focus on how to express the enumeration in a way that is
both efficient and easy to read. For example, the above could be rewritten as:
```csharp
var text = """
           Key;Value
           A;1.1
           B;2.2
           """;
var expected = new (string Key, double Value)[] {
    ("B", 2.2),
};

using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
var actual = Enumerate(reader).ToArray();

CollectionAssert.AreEqual(expected, actual);

static IEnumerable<(string Key, double Value)> Enumerate(SepReader reader)
{
    foreach (var row in reader)
    {
        var keyCol = row["Key"];
        if (keyCol.Span.StartsWith("B"))
        {
            yield return (keyCol.ToString(), row["Value"].Parse<double>());
        }
    }
}
```
This does not take significantly longer to write and is a lot more efficient
(also avoids allocating a string for key for each row) and is easier to debug
and perhaps even read. All examples above can be seen in
[ReadMeTest.cs](src/Sep.Test/ReadMeTest.cs).

### SepWriter API
`SepWriter` API has the following structure (in pseudo-C# code):
```csharp
using var writer = Sep.Writer(o => o).ToFile/ToText/To...;
foreach (var data in EnumerateData())
{
    using var row = writer.NewRow();
    var _ = row[colName/colNames].Set/Format<T>...;
    var _ = row[colIndex/colIndices].Set/Format<T>...;
}
```
That is, to use `SepWriter` follow the points below:

 1. Optionally define `Sep` or use default automatically inferred separator.
 1. Specify writer with optional configuration of `SepWriterOptions`.
    For all options consult the properties on the options type.
 1. Specify destination e.g. file, text (`string` via `StringWriter`),
    `TextWriter`, etc. via `To` extension methods.
 1. MISSING: `SepWriter` currently does not allow you to define the header up
    front. Instead, header is defined by the order in which column names are
    accessed/created when defining the row.
 1. Define new rows with `NewRow`. ⚠ Be sure to dispose any new rows before
    starting the next! For convenience Sep provides an overload for `NewRow` that
    takes a `SepReader.Row` and copies the columns from that row to the new row:
    ```csharp
    using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
    using var writer = reader.Spec.Writer().ToText();
    foreach (var readRow in reader)
    {   using var writeRow = writer.NewRow(readRow); }
    ```
 1. Create a column by selecting by name or index. Or multiple columns via
    indices and names. `Sep` internally handles pooled allocation and reuse of
    arrays for multiple columns.
 1. Use `Set` to set the column value either as a `ReadOnlySpan<char>`, `string`
    or via an interpolated string. Or use `Format<T>` where `T : IFormattable`
    to format `T` to the column value.
 1. Row is written when `Dispose` is called on the row. 
    > Note this is to allow a row to be defined flexibly with both column
    > removal, moves and renames in the future. This is not yet supported.

## Limitations and Constraints
Sep is designed to be minimal and fast. As such, it has some limitations and
constraints, since these are not needed for the initial intended usage:

 * Automatic escaping and unescaping quotes is not supported. Use
   [`Trim`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.memoryextensions.trim)
   extension method to remove surrounding quotes, for example.
 * Comments `#` are not directly supported. You can skip a row by:
   ```csharp
   foreach (var row in reader)
   {
        // Skip row if starts with #
        if (!row.Span.StartsWith("#"))
        {
             // ...
        }
   }
   ```
   This does not allow skipping a header row starting with `#` though.
 * `SepWriter` is not yet fully featured and one cannot skip writing a header
   currently.

## Comparison Benchmarks
To investigate the performance of Sep it is compared to:

 * [CsvHelper](https://github.com/JoshClose/csvhelper) - *the* most commonly
   used CSV library with a staggering
   ![downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/csvhelper) downloads on NuGet. Fully
   featured and battle tested.
 * [Sylvan](https://github.com/MarkPflug/Sylvan) - is well-known and has
   previously been shown to be [the fastest CSV libraries for
   parsing](https://www.joelverhagen.com/blog/2020/12/fastest-net-csv-parsers)
   (Sep changes that 😉).
 * `ReadLine`/`WriteLine` - basic naive implementations that read line by line
   and split on separator. While writing columns, separators and line endings
   directly. Does not handle quotes or similar correctly.

All benchmarks are run from/to memory either with:

 * `StringReader` or `StreamReader + MemoryStream`
 * `StringWriter` or `StreamWriter + MemoryStream`

This to avoid confounding factors from reading from or writing to disk.

When using `StringReader`/`StringWriter` each `char` counts as 2 bytes, when
measuring throughput e.g. `MB/s`. When using `StreamReader`/`StreamWriter`
content is UTF-8 encoded and each `char` typically counts as 1 byte, as content
usually limited to 1 byte per char in UTF-8.  Note that in .NET for `TextReader`
and `TextWriter` data is converted to/from `char`, but for reading such
conversion can often be just as fast as `Memmove`.

By default only `StringReader`/`StringWriter` results are shown, if a result is
based on `StreamReader`/`StreamWriter` it will be called out. Usually, results
for `StreamReader`/`StreamWriter` are in line with `StringReader`/`StringWriter`
but with half the throughput due to 1 byte vs 2 bytes. For brevity they are not
shown here.

For all benchmark results, Sep has been defined as the `Baseline` in
[BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/). This means `Ratio` will be 1.00
for Sep. For the others `Ratio` will then show how many *times* faster Sep is
than that. Or how many *times* more bytes are allocated in `Alloc Ratio`.

### Runtime and Platforms
The following runtime is used for benchmarking:
* `NET 7.0.5 (7.0.523.17405)`

The following platforms are used for benchmarking:

* `AMD 5950X` X64 Platform Information
  ``` ini
  OS=Windows 10 (10.0.19044.2846/21H2/November2021Update)
  AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, 1 CPU, 32 logical and 16 physical cores
  ```
* `Snapdragon® 8cx Gen 3` ARM64 Platform Information (courtesy of [@xoofx](https://github.com/xoofx))
  ```ini
  OS=Windows 11 (10.0.22621.1702/22H2/2022Update/SunValley2)
  Snapdragon Compute Platform, 1 CPU, 8 logical and 8 physical cores
  ```

### Reader Comparison Benchmarks
The following reader scenarios are benchmarked:

 * [NCsvPerf](https://github.com/joelverhagen/NCsvPerf) from [The fastest CSV
   parser in
   .NET](https://www.joelverhagen.com/blog/2020/12/fastest-net-csv-parsers)
 * [**Floats**](#floats-reader-comparison-benchmarks) as for example in machine learning.

Details for each can be found in the following. However, for each of these 3
different scopes are benchmarked to better assertain the low-level performance
of each library and approach and what parts of the parsing consume the most
time:

 * **Row** - for this scope only the row is enumerated. That is, for Sep all
   that is done is:
   ```csharp
   foreach (var row in reader) { }
   ```
   this should capture parsing both row and columns but without accessing these.
   Note that some libraries (like Sylvan) will defer work for columns to when
   these are accessed.
 * **Cols** - for this scope all rows and all columns are enumerated. If
   possible columns are accessed as spans, if not as strings, which then might
   mean a string has to be allocated. That is, for Sep this is:
   ```csharp
   foreach (var row in reader)

#### NCsvPerf PackageAssets Reader Comparison Benchmarks
[NCsvPerf](https://github.com/joelverhagen/NCsvPerf) from [The fastest CSV
   parser in
   .NET](https://www.joelverhagen.com/blog/2020/12/fastest-net-csv-parsers) is a
   benchmark which in [Joel Verhagen](https://twitter.com/joelverhagen) own
   words was defined with:

> My goal was to find the fastest low-level CSV parser. Essentially, all I
> wanted was a library that gave me a string[] for each line where each field in
> the line was an element in the array.

What is great about this work is it tests a whole of 35 different libraries and
approaches to this. Providing a great overview of those and their performance on
this specific scenario. Given Sylvan is the fastest of those it is used as the
one to beat here, while CsvHelper is used to compare to the most commonly used
library.

The source used for this benchmark [PackageAssetsBench.cs](src/Sep.ComparisonBenchmarks/PackageAssetsBench.cs) is a
[PackageAssets.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joelverhagen/NCsvPerf/main/NCsvPerf/TestData/PackageAssets.csv)
with NuGet package information in 25 columns with rows like:

For `Scope = Asset` the columns are parsed into a
[`PackageAsset`](src/Sep.ComparisonBenchmarks/PackageAsset.cs) class, which
consists of 25 properties of which 22 are `string`s. Each asset is accumulated
into a `List<PackageAsset>`. Each column is accessed as a `string` regardless.

This means this benchmark is dominated by turning columns into `string`s for the
decently fast parsers. Hence, the fastest libraries in this test employ string
pooling. That is, basically a custom dictionary from `ReadOnlySpan<char>` to
`string`, which avoids allocating a new `string` for repeated values. And as can
be seen in the csv-file there are a lot of repeated values. Both Sylvan and
CsvHelper do this in the benchmark. So does Sep and as with Sep this is an
optional configuration that has to be explicitly enable. For Sep this means the
reader is created with something like:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader(o => o with
{
    HasHeader = false,
    CreateToString = SepToString.PoolPerCol(maximumStringLength: 128),
})
.From(CreateReader());
```
What is unique for Sep is that it allows defining a pool per column e.g. via
`SepToString.PoolPerCol(...)`. This is based on the fact
that often each column has its own set of values or strings that may be repeated
without any overlap to other columns. This also allows one to define per column
specific handling of `ToString` behavior. Whether to pool or not. Or even to use
a statically defined pool.

##### PackageAssets Benchmark Results
The results below show Sep is now **the fastest .NET CSV Parser** (for this
benchmark on these platforms and machines 😀). While for pure parsing allocating
only a fraction of the memory due to extensive use of pooling and the
`ArrayPool<T>`.

This is in many aspects due to Sep having extremely optimized string pooling and
optimized hashing of `ReadOnlySpan<char>`, and thus not really due the the
csv-parsing itself, since that is not a big part of the time consumed. At least
not for a decently fast csv-parser.

##### PackageAssets with Quotes Benchmark Results
`NCsvPerf` does not examine performance in the face of quotes in the csv. This
is relevant since some libraries like Sylvan will revert to a slower (not SIMD
vectorized) parsing code path if it encounters quotes. Sep was designed to
always use SIMD vectorization no matter what. 

Since there are two extra `char`s to handle per column, it does have a
significant impact on performance, no matter what though. This is expected when
looking at the numbers. For each row of 25 columns, there are 24 separators
(here `,`) and one set of line endings (here `\r\n`). That's 26 characters.
Adding quotes around each of the 25 columns will add 50 characters or almost
triple the total to 76.

#### Floats Reader Comparison Benchmarks
The [FloatsReaderBench.cs](src/Sep.ComparisonBenchmarks/FloatsReaderBench.cs)
benchmark demonstrates what Sep is built for. Namely parsing 32-bit floating
points or features as in machine learning. Here a simple CSV-file is randomly
generated with `N` ground truth values, `N` predicted result values and some
typical extra columns leading that, but which aren't used as such in the
benchmark. `N = 20` here. For example:

For `Scope=Floats` the benchmark will parse the features as two spans of
`float`s; one for ground truth values and one for predicted result values. Then
calculates the mean squared error (MSE) of those as an example. For Sep this
code is succinct and still incredibly efficient:
```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader().From(Reader.CreateReader());

var groundTruthColNames = reader.Header.NamesStartingWith("GT_");
var resultColNames = groundTruthColNames.Select(n =>
    n.Replace("GT_", "RE_", StringComparison.Ordinal))
    .ToArray();

var sum = 0.0;
var count = 0;
foreach (var row in reader)
{
    var gts = row[groundTruthColNames].Parse<float>();
    var res = row[resultColNames].Parse<float>();

    sum += MeanSquaredError(gts, res);
    ++count;
}
return sum / count;
````
Note how one can access and parse multiple columns easily while there are no
repeated allocations for the parsed floating points. Sep internally handles a
pool of arrays for handling multiple columns and returns spans for them.

The benchmark is based on an assumption of accessing columns by name per
row. Ideally, one would look up the indices of the columns by name before
enumerating rows, but this is a repeated nuisance to have to handle and Sep was
built to avoid this. Hence, the comparison is based on looking up by name for
each, even if this ends up adding a bit more code in the benchmark for other
approaches.

As can be seen below, the actual low level parsing of the separated values is a
tiny part of the total runtime for Sep for which the run time is dominated by
parsing the floating points. Since Sep uses
[csFastFloat](https://github.com/CarlVerret/csFastFloat) for an integrated fast
floating point parser, it is **>2x faster than Sylvan** for example. If using
Sylvan one may consider using csFastFloat if that is an option.

CsvHelper suffers from the fact that one can only access the column as a string
so this has to be allocated for each column (ReadLine by definition always
allocates a string per column). Still CsvHelper is significantly slower than the
naive `ReadLine` approach. With Sep being **>3.8x faster than CsvHelper**.

It is a testament to how good the .NET and the .NET GC is that the ReadLine is
pretty good compared to CsvHelper regardless of allocating a lot of strings.

### Writer Comparison Benchmarks
Writer benchmarks are still pending, but Sep is unlikely to be the fastest here
since it is explicitly designed to make writing more convenient and flexible.
Still efficient, but not necessarily fastest. That is, Sep does not require
writing header up front and hence having to keep header column order and row
values column order the same. This means Sep does not write columns *directly*
upon definition but defers this until a new row has been fully defined and then
is ended.

## Example Catalogue
The following examples are available in [ReadMeTest.cs](src/Sep.Test/ReadMeTest.cs).

### Example - Copy Rows
```csharp
var text = """
           A;B;C;D;E;F
           Sep;🚀;1;1.2;0.1;0.5
           CSV;✅;2;2.2;0.2;1.5
           """;

using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
using var writer = reader.Spec.Writer().ToText();
foreach (var readRow in reader)
{
    using var writeRow = writer.NewRow(readRow);
}

Assert.AreEqual(text, writer.ToString());
```

## RFC-4180
While the [RFC-4180](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) requires `\r\n`
(CR,LF) as line ending, the well-known line endings (`\r\n`, `\n` and `\r`) are
supported similar to .NET. `Environment.NewLine` is used when writing. Quoting
is supported by simply matching pairs of quotes, no matter what. With no
automatic escaping. Hence, you are responsible and in control of this at this
time. 

Note that some libraries will claim conformance but the RFC is, perhaps
naturally, quite strict e.g. only comma is supported as separator/delimiter. Sep
defaults to using `;` as separator if writing, while auto-detecting supported
separators when reading. This is decidedly non-conforming.

The RFC defines the following condensed [ABNF
grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form):
```
file = [header CRLF] record *(CRLF record) [CRLF]
header = name *(COMMA name)
record = field *(COMMA field)
name = field
field = (escaped / non-escaped)
escaped = DQUOTE *(TEXTDATA / COMMA / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE
non-escaped = *TEXTDATA
COMMA = %x2C
CR = %x0D ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]
DQUOTE =  %x22 ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]
LF = %x0A ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]
CRLF = CR LF ;as per section 6.1 of RFC 2234 [2]
TEXTDATA =  %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-7E
```
Note how `TEXTDATA` is restricted too, yet many will allow any character incl.
emojis or similar (which Sep supports), but is not in conformance with the RFC.

Quotes inside an escaped field e.g. `"fie""ld"` are only allowed to be double
quotes. Sep currently allows any pairs of quotes and quoting doesn't need to be
at start of or end of field (col or column in Sep terminology).

All in all Sep takes a pretty pragmatic approach here as the primary use case is
**not** exchanging data on the internet, but for use in machine learning
pipelines or similar.
